# Axiom 🚀

**The first Wayland compositor combining niri's scrollable workspace innovation with Hyprland's visual effects system.**

> *Where productivity meets beauty*

</div>

## ✨ Vision

Axiom bridges the gap between productivity-focused tiling window managers and visually stunning compositors. Why choose between infinite scrollable workspaces OR beautiful animations when you can have both?

## 🎯 Features

### Scrollable Workspaces (niri-inspired)
- **Infinite horizontal scrolling** - No artificial workspace limits
- **Smart window placement** - Automatic, intelligent tiling
- **Smooth navigation** - Keyboard and gesture-based scrolling
- **Dynamic layouts** - Adapts to your workflow

### Visual Effects (Hyprland-inspired)  
- **Smooth animations** - Buttery 60fps window operations
- **Blur effects** - Configurable background and border blur
- **Rounded corners** - Anti-aliased, customizable radius
- **Drop shadows** - Realistic lighting effects
- **Workspace transitions** - Animated scrolling between spaces

### Hybrid Innovations (Axiom-exclusive)
- **Animated workspace scrolling** - Smooth visual transitions while scrolling
- **Context-aware effects** - Smart performance scaling during intensive operations
- **Unified configuration** - Single config for both tiling and effects

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Language**: Rust (memory safety + performance)
- **Foundation**: wlroots (proven stability + ecosystem)
- **Graphics**: OpenGL/Vulkan for effects
- **Compatibility**: Full XWayland support

## 🚀 Development Status

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | 🟡 Planning | Basic compositor foundation |
| **Phase 2** | 🔴 Planned | Scrollable workspace implementation |
| **Phase 3** | 🔴 Planned | Visual effects system |
| **Phase 4** | 🔴 Planned | Advanced features & polish |

**Target**: v1.0 release in 12 months

## 🛠️ Building

*Coming soon - currently in planning phase*

```bash
# Dependencies (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S rustup wlroots-git libxkbcommon wayland wayland-protocols

# Build (future)
cargo build --release
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Axiom uses a single TOML configuration file combining the best of both worlds:

```toml
# ~/.config/axiom/axiom.toml
[workspace]
scroll_speed = 1.0
infinite_scroll = true

[animations] 
enabled = true
duration = 300
curve = "ease-out"

[effects]
blur_radius = 10
rounded_corners = 8
shadow_size = 20

[bindings]
scroll_left = "Super_L+Left"
scroll_right = "Super_L+Right"
```
