## Timeline Estimates

| Task | Estimated Time | Dependencies |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Visual Validation | 1-2 days | Display environment |

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Visual Validation Delay**
   - Risk: Display environment not available
   - Mitigation: Continue with headless testing, prepare scripts
   - Impact: Delays other work

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: FPS below 60 with multiple windows
   - Mitigation: Profiling and optimization
   - Impact: May require architectural changes

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Application Compatibility**
   - Risk: Real apps have issues with rendering
   - Mitigation: Test with diverse applications
   - Impact: May require protocol fixes

2. **Memory Leaks**
   - Risk: Long-running compositor leaks memory
   - Mitigation: Valgrind testing, resource tracking
   - Impact: Requires careful cleanup code

## Notes

### Phase 6.3 vs 6.4 Boundary

Some tasks (like effects integration) may be deferred to Phase 6.4 based on:
- Time constraints
- Risk assessment
- Priority of other features

Current plan: **Complete visual validation and damage optimization in 6.3**, defer effects to 6.4 if needed.

### Communication

For async work:
- Update this checklist as tasks complete
- Document blockers and workarounds
- Share visual validation results when available
- Report any performance issues early
