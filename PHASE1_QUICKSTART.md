# Phase 1 Quick Start - Testing Axiom with Real Clients

**Status**: Ready to Test! üöÄ  
**Date**: 2025-10-09

---

## üéØ What We're Testing

We discovered that **Axiom already has all the infrastructure for Phase 1 implemented!** Now we just need to test if real Wayland clients work.

---

## üöÄ Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Build Axiom
```bash
cd /home/quinton/axiom
cargo build --release --features="smithay,wgpu-present" --bin run_present_winit
```

### Step 2: Run Axiom in Terminal 1
```bash
./target/release/run_present_winit 2>&1 | tee axiom.log
```

**Look for**:
- ‚úÖ "Wayland socket listening at wayland-X"
- ‚úÖ "Renderer created successfully"
- ‚úÖ No crash messages

### Step 3: Test Client in Terminal 2

**Find the socket first**:
```bash
export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=$(ls -1 /run/user/$(id -u)/wayland-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | xargs basename 2>/dev/null)
echo "Using socket: $WAYLAND_DISPLAY"
```

**Test 1: Protocol Check**
```bash
weston-info | head -50
```

**Expected**: Should list all the protocols Axiom supports

**Test 2: Simple Graphics Test**
```bash
weston-simple-shm
```

**Expected**: 
- Window appears in Axiom
- Shows a colorful square
- Square animates (color cycles)

**Test 3: Terminal Test**
```bash
weston-terminal
```

**Expected**:
- Terminal window appears
- Can type text
- Text is visible and correct

## üìä What to Check in Logs

### Success Indicators:

```bash
grep -E "mapped window|queue_texture_update|renderer now has" axiom.log
```

**You should see**:
- `"mapped window id=Some(X)"` - Window was created
- `"queue_texture_update"` - Texture data queued
- `"renderer now has X windows"` - Renderer tracking windows

### Detailed Flow:

1. **Client connects**:
   ```
   [INFO] New client connected
   ```

2. **Window created**:
   ```
   [DEBUG] xdg_surface created
   [DEBUG] xdg_toplevel created
   ```

3. **Buffer attached**:
   ```
   [DEBUG] Buffer attached: id=X, size=WxH
   ```

4. **Window mapped**:
   ```
   [INFO] axiom: mapped window id=Some(X)
   [DEBUG] ‚ûï push_placeholder_quad: id=X
   ```

5. **Texture uploaded**:
   ```
   [DEBUG] üì• Processing N pending texture updates
   [DEBUG] ‚úÖ Updated texture for window X
   ```

6. **Rendering**:
   ```
   [DEBUG] üé® Rendering N windows to surface
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Wayland socket found"

**Cause**: Axiom isn't running or crashed at startup

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check if process is running
ps aux | grep run_present_winit

# Check logs for errors
tail -50 axiom.log
```

### Issue: Client connects but no window appears

**Check logs for**:
```bash
grep -i "error\|panic\|crash" axiom.log
```

**Common causes**:
1. Configure handshake not completing
2. Buffer format not supported
3. GPU texture creation failed

**Debug**:
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/run_present_winit 2>&1 | tee axiom_debug.log
```

### Issue: Window appears but is black

**Possible causes**:
1. Texture not being uploaded
2. Format conversion issue
3. Bind group not set up

**Check**:
```bash
grep "queue_texture_update\|update_window_texture" axiom.log
```

### Issue: Can't type in terminal

**Possible causes**:
1. Input routing not working
2. Focus not set
3. Keyboard events not forwarded

**Check**:
```bash
grep -E "KeyPress|focus|enter|leave" axiom.log
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Testing

### Test Multiple Clients
```bash
export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-2  # or whatever socket

# Run 3 clients at once
weston-simple-shm &
sleep 1
weston-simple-shm &
sleep 1
weston-terminal &

# Wait a bit
sleep 5

# Check logs
grep "renderer now has" axiom.log | tail -1
```

**Expected**: "renderer now has 3 windows"

### Test Real Terminals

If you have these installed:
```bash
# foot (Wayland-native terminal)
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-2 foot

# alacritty
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-2 alacritty

# kitty
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-2 kitty
```

### Test Input Focus
```bash
# Run terminal
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-2 weston-terminal

# In the terminal, type:
echo "Hello Axiom!"
ls -la
# etc.

# Check if text appears correctly
```

## üìö What We Learned

From the code analysis, we found:

1. **Buffer handling is complete**: Full wl_shm implementation with format conversion
2. **Surface lifecycle works**: Proper create/commit/destroy handling
3. **Texture pipeline ready**: Queue-based async texture uploads
4. **Input routing implemented**: Keyboard/mouse forwarding with focus management
5. **XDG shell fully functional**: Configure/ack handshake, window states, etc.

**The infrastructure is ~95% complete!** We just need to verify it works in practice.

---

## üî• If You Find Issues

### Add More Debug Logging

Edit `src/smithay/server.rs` and add more `debug!()` calls:

```rust
// Around line 5230 (in commit handler)
debug!("üîç Commit: should_map={}, has_buffer={}, ack_ok={}", 
    should_map, has_buffer, ack_ok);

// Around line 5040 (texture upload)
debug!("üñºÔ∏è Uploading texture: id={}, size={}x{}, bytes={}", 
    id, w, h, data.len());
```

Then rebuild and test again with `RUST_LOG=debug`.

### Compare with Smithay Anvil

If stuck, compare behavior with Smithay's reference compositor:
```bash
# Clone and build anvil
git clone https://github.com/Smithay/smithay.git
cd smithay/anvil
cargo build --release

# Run it
./target/release/anvil

# Test with same clients
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 weston-simple-shm
```

**Ready to test! Let's see if Axiom can already run real Wayland apps! üöÄ**
