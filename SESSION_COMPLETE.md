- ✅ Confirmed XDG shell, wl_seat, wl_surface all working

### 2. Phase 6.3: Rendering Pipeline ✅ 90% COMPLETE
- ✅ Built GPU rendering system with wgpu
- ✅ Initialized NVIDIA RTX 3050 with Vulkan backend
- ✅ Created on-screen presentation with winit
- ✅ Verified render loop running at 60 FPS

## 🚀 How to Run Axiom

### Start the Compositor

```bash
cd /home/quinton/axiom

# Run Axiom (will open fullscreen window)
./run_axiom.sh
```

This will:
1. Open a fullscreen Axiom compositor window
2. Create Wayland socket (check logs for WAYLAND_DISPLAY value)
3. Start rendering at 60 FPS with GPU acceleration
4. Initialize XWayland support

### Launch Applications in Axiom

Once Axiom is running, in another terminal:

```bash
# Get the WAYLAND_DISPLAY from Axiom logs (usually wayland-2)
export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-2

# Launch any Wayland application
weston-terminal
# or
firefox
# or
foot
# or any other Wayland app
```

   export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-2  # Check your logs
   weston-terminal
   ```

### Short-term (1-2 days)
3. **Verify window display**
   - Windows should be visible
   - If not, check logs for texture upload confirmations
   - Verify placeholders are being pushed

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If windows don't appear:
1. Check logs for "Rendered N windows"
2. Verify texture uploads: grep "queue_texture_update" in logs
3. Check placeholder quads: grep "push_placeholder_quad" in logs
4. Ensure `sync_from_shared()` is being called in render loop

### If clients can't connect:
1. Check WAYLAND_DISPLAY value in logs
2. Export the correct WAYLAND_DISPLAY in client terminal
3. Verify socket exists: `ls $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-*`

### If rendering is slow:
1. Check GPU is being used (should see NVIDIA in logs)
2. Verify Vulkan backend (check logs)
3. Look for frame time warnings
