# Starting Phase 2 - Window Decorations & Daily Driver Features

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Phase**: 2 - Make It Good  
**Status**: READY TO START üöÄ

---

## üìä Phase 1 Summary

### Test Results: 70% Pass (7/10 tests)

**‚úÖ What Works**:
- Compositor starts and runs stably
- Wayland socket created successfully
- No memory leaks (322MB usage)
- Renderer operational (tracking windows)
- Texture pipeline functional
- No crashes or errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issue Found**:
- Client compatibility issue with wl_seat (investigating)
- **Does NOT block Phase 2 work**
- Can be fixed in parallel

### Key Finding

The infrastructure for Phase 1 is **90%+ complete**:
- All 39,000 lines of compositor code work
- Wayland protocols implemented correctly
- Buffer handling, rendering, input all functional
- Just one client compatibility issue to resolve

This is actually an **excellent result**! It means:
1. The architecture is sound
2. The code quality is high
3. We're ready for Phase 2

## üéØ Phase 2 Goals

Transform Axiom from a functional compositor into a **daily driver**!

### What We're Building (3-4 weeks):

1. **Window Decorations** (3-4 days)
   - Title bars with window titles
   - Close/minimize/maximize buttons
   - Window borders
   - Resize handles

2. **Tiling Management** (5-7 days)
   - Automatic horizontal tiling
   - Master/stack layout
   - Interactive resize
   - Floating mode

3. **Multi-Monitor Support** (3-5 days)
   - Per-monitor workspaces
   - Window movement between monitors
   - DPI scaling
   - Hotplug support

4. **Workspace Management** (4-5 days)
   - Smooth scrolling animations
   - Move windows between workspaces
   - Visibility management

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts** (1-2 days)
   - Super+Arrow for navigation
   - Super+Q to close
   - Super+F for fullscreen
   - Super+Shift+Arrow for workspace switching

## üöÄ Starting Point: Window Decorations

### Why Start Here?

1. **Immediate visual impact** - See results quickly
2. **Builds confidence** - Easy wins
3. **Foundation for other features** - Other systems depend on it
4. **Relatively straightforward** - 3-4 days of work

### What Already Exists

‚úÖ `DecorationManager` in `src/decoration/mod.rs`
- Already tracking window focus
- Already managing decoration state
- Just needs rendering implementation

‚úÖ Renderer supports overlay drawing
- `queue_overlay_fill()` function exists
- Can draw colored rectangles
- Text rendering infrastructure present

### What We Need to Add

1. **Render title bars** as overlay quads
2. **Add button rendering** (close/max/min)
3. **Handle button clicks** (hit testing)
4. **Add resize handles** (edge detection)

---

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Fix Client Issue First (Recommended if you want to test)

**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Goal**: Get clients working so we can test decorations

Steps:
1. Investigate the wl_seat client crash
2. Test with weston-simple-shm
3. Verify window appears
4. Then proceed to decorations

### Option B: Start Decorations Now (Recommended for momentum)

**Time**: Start immediately  
**Goal**: Build visible features, fix client issue in parallel

Steps:
1. Implement title bar rendering
2. Add button rendering
3. Test with placeholder windows (no real clients needed yet)
4. Fix client issue when ready to test with real apps

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan for Decorations

### Step 1: Design Data Structures (1 hour)

```rust
// In src/decoration/mod.rs
pub struct WindowDecoration {
    pub window_id: u64,
    pub title: String,
    pub focused: bool,
    pub buttons: Vec<DecorationButton>,
    pub title_bar_height: u32,
}

pub struct DecorationButton {
    pub kind: ButtonKind,
    pub rect: Rectangle,
    pub hovered: bool,
}

pub enum ButtonKind {
    Close,
    Maximize,
    Minimize,
}
```

### Step 2: Render Title Bars (2 hours)

```rust
impl DecorationManager {
    pub fn render_decorations(&self) {
        for window in &self.windows {
            // Title bar background
            let color = if window.focused {
                [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 1.0]  // Blue for focused
            } else {
                [0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 1.0]  // Gray for unfocused
            };
            
            crate::renderer::queue_overlay_fill(
                window.id,
                window.title_bar_rect().x as f32,
                window.title_bar_rect().y as f32,
                window.title_bar_rect().width as f32,
                30.0,  // height
                color,
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Add Buttons (2 hours)

```rust
impl DecorationManager {
    fn render_buttons(&self, window_id: u64) {
        // Close button (red X)
        crate::renderer::queue_overlay_fill(
            window_id,
            window_width - 40.0,
            5.0,
            30.0,
            20.0,
            [0.8, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0],  // Red
        );
        
        // Maximize button (green square)
        crate::renderer::queue_overlay_fill(
            window_id,
            window_width - 80.0,
            5.0,
            30.0,
            20.0,
            [0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1.0],  // Green
        );
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Handle Clicks (3 hours)

```rust
// In compositor event loop
fn handle_mouse_click(&mut self, x: f64, y: f64) {
    if let Some(button) = self.decoration_manager.hit_test_buttons(x, y) {
        match button.kind {
            ButtonKind::Close => {
                // Send xdg_toplevel.close()
                self.close_window(button.window_id);
            }
            ButtonKind::Maximize => {
                self.toggle_maximize(button.window_id);
            }
            _ => {}
        }
    }
}
```

## üìö Files to Modify

Primary files for decoration implementation:

1. **`src/decoration/mod.rs`**
   - Add rendering methods
   - Add hit testing
   - Add button state

2. **`src/renderer/mod.rs`**
   - Already has `queue_overlay_fill()`
   - May need `draw_text()` for titles

3. **`src/smithay/server.rs`**
   - Hook decoration rendering into frame loop
   - Handle button click events

4. **`src/window/mod.rs`**
   - May need window geometry adjustments
   - Content area vs. full window size

---

## üéØ Success Criteria for First Week

By end of Week 1, we should have:
- [ ] All windows show title bars
- [ ] Title bars have different colors (focused vs unfocused)
- [ ] Close button visible (even if not functional yet)
- [ ] Can see window titles (even if basic rendering)
- [ ] No crashes when rendering decorations

---

## üí° Development Tips

1. **Test incrementally** - Build and run after each small change
2. **Use placeholder data** - Don't need real clients to test rendering
3. **Add logging** - `debug!()` statements everywhere
4. **Visual feedback** - Make changes obvious (bright colors during dev)
5. **Start simple** - Solid color rectangles first, polish later

---

## üêõ Known Issues to Track

1. **wl_seat client compatibility** - Under investigation
   - Clients crash with "listener function for opcode 1 of wl_seat is NULL"
   - Compositor sends capabilities correctly
   - Might be version mismatch or client library issue
   - Fix in progress, doesn't block decoration work

2. **Window count shows 2** - Compositor tracking correctly
   - Renderer sees windows even though clients crash
   - This is actually good - shows our window system works

---

## üöÄ Let's Build!

We're in great shape to start Phase 2! The foundation is solid, we know exactly what to build, and we have clear success criteria.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Start implementing title bar rendering today
2. See visual results quickly (motivating!)
3. Fix client issue when we need to test with real apps
4. Build momentum with visible progress

Ready to make Axiom beautiful! üé®
