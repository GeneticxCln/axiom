echo "🚀 Real Application Testing Guide"
echo "================================="
echo ""
echo "To test real window rendering with actual applications:"
echo ""
echo "1. Start the compositor:"
echo "   cargo run --features \"smithay,wgpu-present\" --release -- --backend auto"
echo ""
echo "2. In another terminal, set the display and test applications:"
echo "   export WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1"
echo "   weston-terminal    # Should show real terminal text"
echo "   firefox           # Should show actual web content"
echo "   foot              # Another terminal test"
echo "   nautilus          # File manager with real content"
echo ""
echo "3. Expected Results:"
echo "   ✅ Windows display REAL content instead of colored rectangles"
echo "   ✅ Text is crisp and readable"
echo "   ✅ Animations and effects work on real content"
echo "   ✅ Scrolling and interactions are responsive"
echo "   ✅ Multiple windows work simultaneously"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Performance Benchmarking"
echo "==========================="
echo ""
echo "Monitor these metrics during testing:"
echo "- Frame rate should maintain 60 FPS with multiple windows"
echo "- Memory usage should remain stable (< 200MB with 5 windows)"
echo "- GPU utilization should be moderate (< 60% typical)"
echo "- Window creation should be fast (< 50ms)"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Troubleshooting"
echo "=================="
echo ""
echo "If you see colored rectangles instead of real content:"
echo "1. Check that buffer conversion is working:"
echo "   grep \"Converting.*to RGBA\" target/release/axiom.log"
echo ""
echo "2. Check texture uploads are happening:"
echo "   grep \"texture.*upload\" target/release/axiom.log"
echo ""
echo "3. Check for GPU errors:"
echo "   grep \"GPU\\|wgpu\\|render\" target/release/axiom.log"
echo ""

echo "📈 Performance Analysis"
echo "======================"
echo ""
echo "Use these commands to monitor performance:"
echo ""
echo "# Monitor system resources:"
echo "htop"
echo ""
echo "# Monitor GPU usage (NVIDIA):"
echo "nvidia-smi -l 1"
echo ""
echo "# Monitor memory usage:"
echo "watch -n 1 'ps aux | grep axiom'"
