## What Changed

### For Developers

**If you were using `backend_real`:**
```rust
// OLD (deprecated)
use axiom::backend_real::RealBackend;

// NEW (production)
use axiom::smithay::server::CompositorServer;
```

**Deprecation Warning:**
```
warning: use of deprecated module `axiom::backend_real`
  |
  | pub mod backend_real;
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: Use smithay/server.rs instead. See docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md
```

### For Learners

**Reference implementations still available:**
- All experimental backends archived in `docs/reference/`
- Comprehensive README explains what to learn from each
- Code examples for keyboard, pointer, XDG validation, calloop

**Learning Path:**
1. Start with `docs/reference/backend_simple_archived.rs` (socket basics)
2. Move to `backend_basic_archived.rs` (basic protocols)
3. Study `backend_real_archived.rs` (full implementation)
4. Graduate to `smithay/server.rs` (production code)

## Why This Decision Was Made

### The Numbers

| Metric | smithay/server.rs | backend_real | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Lines of Code | 7,542 | 1,437 | **5x more** |
| Protocols | 20+ | 8 | **2.5x more** |
| Buffer Rendering | ✅ Full | ❌ None | **Infinite** |
| Production Ready | ✅ NOW | ❌ 6+ months | **∞ time saved** |

### The Features

**smithay has but backend_real lacks:**
- SHM buffer rendering (critical!)
- DMABUF support (performance!)
- Layer-shell (panels/bars!)
- Clipboard/DnD (essential!)
- Multi-output (modern setups!)
- Presentation timing (vsync!)
- Viewporter (scaling!)
- Decorations (UX!)

**Cost to implement missing features in backend_real:**
- ~6,000 lines of code
- ~6 months of development
- Extensive testing and debugging
- Risk of bugs and protocol violations

**Benefit of using smithay:**
- ✅ Production-ready today
- ✅ All features already working
- ✅ Battle-tested code
- ✅ Active maintenance
- ✅ Zero additional development needed

- Understood pointer frame batching
- Learned XDG serial validation
- Practiced calloop event loop patterns

### ✅ Verification
- Confirmed smithay's implementation is correct
- Validated protocol compliance
- Tested calloop integration
- Proved our understanding

### ✅ Reference Code
- Clean, documented examples
- Teaching material for Wayland protocols
- Useful for onboarding new developers
- Historical record of development

### ✅ Code Review
- Can now confidently audit smithay
- Understand every protocol detail
- Know what to look for in issues
- Can contribute improvements

- ✅ Add deprecation notices
- ✅ Create comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Verify compilation

### Short-term (This Week)
- [ ] Update README with architecture clarification
- [ ] Add architecture diagram to main docs
- [ ] Review smithay/server.rs for any missing optimizations
- [ ] Document smithay usage patterns

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Consider removing backend_* files from src/ (keep in git history)
- [ ] Focus all development on smithay enhancements
- [ ] Improve smithay documentation based on our learnings
- [ ] Add integration tests for smithay backend

## FAQ

**Q: Can I still use backend_real for testing?**  
A: It's deprecated but still compiles. However, it lacks rendering so it's of limited use. Use smithay for testing.

**Q: Will backend_real be removed?**  
A: Eventually, yes. It will be removed from `src/` but kept in git history and `docs/reference/`.

**Q: What if I need to learn Wayland protocols?**  
A: Perfect! The archived backends in `docs/reference/` are excellent learning resources.

**Q: Is smithay harder to understand?**  
A: It's larger, but better documented. Start with archived backends for learning, then move to smithay.

**Q: What about performance?**  
A: smithay is faster because it has real rendering, DMABUF, and proper damage tracking.

**Q: Can I contribute to smithay/server.rs?**  
A: Yes! That's where all development should focus now.
