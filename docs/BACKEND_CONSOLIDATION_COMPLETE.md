# Backend Consolidation - Complete ✅

## Summary

The Axiom compositor codebase has been consolidated to use **only the production Smithay backend**. All experimental backend implementations have been archived for historical reference. This simplification makes the codebase more maintainable and focuses development effort on the proven production stack.

## Motivation

During development, the Axiom compositor accumulated several experimental backend implementations in `src/experimental/`. These were created as prototypes and learning exercises while developing the final production backend. With the Smithay production backend now mature and fully functional, maintaining multiple backends was:

1. **Confusing** - Multiple implementations made it unclear which code path was actually used
2. **Maintenance burden** - Code that isn't used still needs to compile and potentially be updated
3. **Build overhead** - Extra code increases compilation times
4. **Documentation complexity** - Explaining multiple backends to new contributors is unnecessarily complex

## What Was Removed

The following experimental backend files were archived (moved to `docs/reference/archived_experimental/`):

### Experimental Directory Contents (19 files, ~6,782 lines of code)

```
src/experimental/
├── mod.rs (deprecated module marker)
└── smithay/
    ├── axiom_real_compositor.rs
    ├── minimal_server.rs
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── multi_output.rs
    ├── real_input.rs
    ├── real_smithay.rs
    ├── real_window.rs
    ├── smithay_backend.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_minimal.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_phase6.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_phase6_2.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_production.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_real.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_real_minimal.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_simple.rs
    ├── smithay_backend_working.rs
    ├── smithay_enhanced.rs
    └── wayland_protocols.rs
```

### Key Points

- **No code actually referenced these files** - The experimental module was already marked as deprecated
- **All functionality preserved** - The production Smithay backend (`src/smithay/`) contains all the working implementations
- **Code not deleted** - Files are preserved in `docs/reference/archived_experimental/` for historical reference

## Production Backend

The Axiom compositor now uses exclusively:

**Location**: `src/smithay/`

**Key Files**:
- `server.rs` - Main compositor server with full Wayland protocol support
- `input_backend.rs` - libinput integration for keyboard, mouse, and touch
- `mod.rs` - Module exports and configuration

**Features**:
- ✅ Full XDG Shell protocol support
- ✅ WLR Layer Shell for panels and overlays
- ✅ Multi-output support with dynamic configuration
- ✅ SHM buffer ingestion and texture upload
- ✅ Security module integration with rate limiting
- ✅ libinput backend for real hardware input
- ✅ Client-side and server-side decoration support
- ✅ Subsurface support for complex window hierarchies
- ✅ Clipboard and primary selection management
- ✅ Presentation time feedback
- ✅ Damage tracking and optimized rendering

## Changes Made

### 1. Archived Experimental Code

```bash
# Moved experimental directory to documentation archive
mv src/experimental docs/reference/archived_experimental/
```

The archived code is available at:
- **Path**: `docs/reference/archived_experimental/experimental/`
- **Size**: 280 KB, 6,782 lines of code
- **Purpose**: Historical reference and learning resource

### 2. Updated Comments

**File**: `src/compositor.rs`

```rust
// Before
//! This implementation can optionally use Smithay for proper Wayland compositor functionality
//! with window management, surface handling, and protocol support when the
//! `experimental-smithay` feature is enabled.

// After
//! The production Smithay backend provides full Wayland compositor functionality
//! with window management, surface handling, and protocol support.
```

**File**: `src/window/mod.rs`

```rust
// Before
// Minimal fallback backend window when experimental-smithay is disabled

// After
// Fallback backend window structure (used internally by window manager)
```

### 3. Simplified Feature Flags

**File**: `Cargo.toml`

Removed obsolete feature flags:
- ~~`real-compositor`~~ - No longer needed, Smithay is always the real compositor

Cleaned up feature documentation:
- Made it clear that `smithay` is the production backend
- Documented `smithay-minimal` as a compatibility alias
- Organized features by purpose (core, rendering, optional enhancements)

**New Feature Organization**:

```toml
[features]
# Production defaults: Smithay backend with on-screen presentation
default = ["smithay", "smithay-minimal", "wgpu-present"]

# Base smithay dependency with minimal protocol frontend
smithay = ["dep:smithay", "smithay/wayland_frontend"]

# Smithay-minimal is an alias for smithay (maintained for compatibility)
smithay-minimal = ["smithay"]

# Full smithay backend capabilities (DRM, udev, libinput, xwayland, GL rendering)
smithay-full = [...]

# Enable on-screen presentation via wgpu + winit
wgpu-present = ["pollster"]

# Enable NVIDIA NVML GPU metrics support
gpu-nvml = ["nvml-wrapper"]

# Vulkan-based dmabuf import for zero-copy GPU buffer sharing
dmabuf-vulkan = ["dep:ash", "dep:libloading"]

# Demo and example features (no-op gates for test/example binaries)
demo = []
examples = []
```

## Build Verification

All build targets verified after consolidation:

### Library Build
```bash
$ cargo check --all-targets
    Finished `dev` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s)
✅ Success - No errors
```

### Test Suite
```bash
$ cargo test --lib
test result: ok. 197 passed; 0 failed; 4 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
✅ All tests pass
```

### Binary Build
```bash
$ cargo build --bins
    Finished `dev` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 45.16s
✅ All binaries build successfully
```

**Generated Binaries**:
- `axiom-compositor` - Main compositor binary
- `run_minimal_wayland` - Minimal headless server
- `run_present_winit` - On-screen presenter with winit window

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Complexity
- Single, well-tested code path
- Clear documentation of what code is actually used
- Easier onboarding for new contributors

### 2. Faster Builds
- ~280 KB less code to compile
- Simplified dependency tree
- Fewer feature flag combinations to test

### 3. Clearer Architecture
- No ambiguity about which backend is production
- Easier to understand the system boundaries
- Better focus for optimization efforts

### 4. Maintainability
- Less code to maintain and update
- Fewer potential points of breakage
- More focused code reviews

## Accessing Archived Code

If you need to reference the experimental backend implementations:

**Location**: `docs/reference/archived_experimental/experimental/`

**Use Cases**:
- Historical research on implementation approaches
- Learning resource for understanding Smithay integration
- Reference for specific protocol handling techniques
- Comparison of different design patterns

**Note**: The archived code is **not maintained** and may not compile with current dependencies. It is provided purely for historical and educational purposes.

## Production Stack Summary

After consolidation, Axiom's compositor stack is:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Axiom Compositor Library               │
│  (window management, workspaces, effects, IPC)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Smithay Production Backend               │
│  (Wayland protocols, client management, input)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              System Layer                        │
│  (libinput, DRM/KMS, GPU drivers, evdev)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Dependencies**:
- `smithay` 0.7.0 - Wayland compositor framework

## Next Steps

With backend consolidation complete, development focus shifts to:

1. **DMA-BUF Integration** - Zero-copy GPU buffer sharing for better performance
2. **Layer Shell Protocol** - Full support for desktop shell components (panels, docks, notifications)
3. **Performance Optimization** - Profile and optimize the single production code path
4. **Real-World Testing** - Test with a variety of Wayland clients and use cases
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for the production backend
