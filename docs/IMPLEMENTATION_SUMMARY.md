## 🚀 Ready to Begin Implementation

### Immediate Next Steps (Today):

1. **Initialize Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_phase1.sh
   ```

2. **Review Implementation Plan**:
   ```bash
   # Read the detailed plan
   less docs/PHASE_1_XDG_SHELL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   
   # Check current tasks
   cat PHASE1_TASKS.md
   ```

3. **Start Phase 1.1 Implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Create development branch
   git checkout -b phase-1/xdg-shell-robustness
   
   # Begin implementation
   $EDITOR src/smithay/surface_state.rs
   ```

### Week 1 Goals:
