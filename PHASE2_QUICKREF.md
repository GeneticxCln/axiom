## ðŸš€ Start Here

**Recommended first task**: Window Decorations  
**Why**: Visual impact, builds confidence, foundation for other features

**Command to start**:
```bash
cd /home/quinton/axiom
git checkout -b phase2-decorations
# Start implementing!
```

## ðŸ“š Key Files

- `src/decoration/mod.rs` - Decoration manager (already exists!)
- `src/window/mod.rs` - Window management
- `src/workspace/mod.rs` - Workspace system
- `src/renderer/mod.rs` - GPU rendering
- `src/smithay/server.rs` - Compositor core
- `src/input/mod.rs` - Input handling
- `axiom.toml` - Configuration

---

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips

1. **Test frequently** - Build and run after each feature
2. **Use logging** - Add debug!() statements liberally
3. **Reference existing code** - Axiom already has great patterns
4. **One feature at a time** - Don't try to do everything at once
5. **Visual feedback** - Make changes visible immediately
