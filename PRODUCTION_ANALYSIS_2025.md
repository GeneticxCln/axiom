### Final Assessment

**You are 4-6 weeks away from shipping a genuinely innovative Wayland compositor** with features that no other compositor combines:
- Scrollable workspaces (niri)
- Visual effects (Hyprland)
- AI optimization (unique)
- Professional architecture

**This is a significant achievement** and represents hundreds of hours of high-quality development work. The path to completion is clear, well-documented, and achievable.

**Recommendation: Complete Axiom. Ship it. Then decide on Lattice.**
