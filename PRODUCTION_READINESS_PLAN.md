# Axiom Compositor - Production Readiness Plan

**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Current Phase**: Post-Crash Fix, Pre-Production  
**Status**: Foundation Stable, Client Integration Needed

---

## üìä Current Project Analysis

### Project Stats
- **Lines of Code**: ~39,000 lines of Rust
- **Files**: 69 Rust source files
- **Architecture**: Modular, well-organized
- **Dependencies**: Modern stack (Smithay, wgpu, tokio)
- **Repository**: Clean and professional

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Priority 1 - COMPLETED!)
1. **‚úÖ Compositor Runs Stably** - No crashes, efficient rendering
2. **‚úÖ Window System** - Opens and resizes without issues  
3. **‚úÖ GPU Rendering** - WGPU pipeline working on NVIDIA RTX 3050
4. **‚úÖ Wayland Server** - Running on `wayland-2`
5. **‚úÖ XWayland** - Started on `DISPLAY=:2`
6. **‚úÖ Performance** - Efficient resource usage, no tight loops
7. **‚úÖ Repository** - Organized, documented, version controlled

### ‚ùå What's Missing (Critical Gaps)

#### **Gap 1: No Wayland Client Support** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Problem**: The compositor starts but clients can't connect and display windows.

**Evidence**:
```
renderer now has 0 windows
```

**Impact**: This is a **show-stopper**. Without this:
- Can't run any Wayland apps (weston-terminal, firefox, etc.)
- Can't test window management
- Can't use it as an actual compositor
- It's just an empty window

**What's Needed**:
1. Client buffer handling (wl_shm, dmabuf)
2. Surface lifecycle management
3. Content rendering from clients
4. Window decorations
5. Input event forwarding to clients

## üî• Critical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Needed:

1. **Compositor Protocol Choice**
   - Current: Smithay framework
   - Decision: ‚úÖ Keep Smithay (good choice)

2. **Rendering Backend**
   - Current: wgpu
   - Decision: ‚úÖ Keep wgpu (modern, flexible)

3. **Buffer Strategy**
   - Options: Copy to GPU texture vs zero-copy
   - Recommendation: Start with copy, optimize later

4. **Window Stack**
   - Current: WindowStack infrastructure ready
   - Decision: ‚úÖ Use existing infrastructure

## üöß Known Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling**: Some unwrap()s should be proper error handling
2. **Memory Management**: Texture pool could be optimized
3. **Protocol Coverage**: Many Wayland protocols not implemented
4. **Testing**: Limited integration test coverage
5. **Performance**: Damage tracking not fully utilized

---

## üí° Recommendations

### For Immediate Progress:
1. **Focus on Phase 1** - Get clients working FIRST
2. **Test continuously** - Use weston-simple-shm, weston-terminal
3. **One feature at a time** - Don't try to do everything
4. **Learn from examples** - Study Smithay anvil example

### For Long-term Success:
1. **Build community early** - Document as you go
2. **Release early** - Alpha releases for feedback
3. **Prioritize stability** - Don't add features until core is solid
4. **Performance matters** - Profile regularly
