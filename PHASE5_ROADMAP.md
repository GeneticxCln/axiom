## Development Timeline 📅

### Month 1-2: Core Stability
- Complete Priority 1 items (testing, error handling, performance)
- Establish CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### Month 3-4: Wayland Client Support  
- Complete Smithay integration
- Test with major applications (Firefox, VSCode, GIMP)
- Resolve compatibility issues

### Month 5-6: AI Integration & Polish
- Finalize Lazy UI integration
- Implement machine learning optimizations
- Performance tuning and optimization

### Month 7-8: Distribution Preparation
- Package for major distributions
- Create documentation and user guides
- Beta testing with community feedback

## Success Metrics 🎯

- [ ] **Stability**: 99.5% uptime in 24-hour stress tests
- [ ] **Compatibility**: 95% of common applications work correctly
