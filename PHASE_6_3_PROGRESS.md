### Day 2 (December 19, 2024)

#### WindowStack and Damage Tracking Integration
- ✅ Added `window_id_to_index` HashMap to AxiomRenderer for O(1) window ID lookups
- ✅ Implemented `rebuild_window_index()` method to maintain index consistency
- ✅ Implemented `remove_window()` method with proper resource cleanup
- ✅ Enhanced `sync_from_shared()` to sync WindowStack and FrameDamage from SharedRenderState
- ✅ Updated `render()` method to use WindowStack for proper Z-ordering
- ✅ Rewrote `render_to_surface_with_outputs_scaled()` to iterate windows in Z-order
- ✅ Added automatic frame damage clearing after successful render
- ✅ Implemented Default trait for SharedRenderState
- ✅ Added comprehensive instrumentation logging for Z-order and damage tracking

## In Progress 🔄

### Current Task: Execute SHM Rendering Tests

**Goal**: Validate end-to-end rendering pipeline with SHM-based clients

**Status**: ✅ Infrastructure complete, ready to execute

**Why SHM?**: 
- GPU clients (alacritty, weston-terminal) fail with "failed to create dri2 screen"
- They're trying to use DMA-BUF which needs full GPU buffer support
- SHM (shared memory) buffers work with our current implementation
- Need to find or create simple SHM-based test client

**Test Clients Available**:
- ✅ C-based client (shm_test_client.c) - 332 lines
- ✅ Python-based client (shm_test_client.py) - 342 lines
- ✅ Automated test script (test_shm_rendering.sh) - 337 lines

**Features**:
- Creates 800x600 window with test pattern
- Red/blue checkerboard with gradients
- Full XDG shell protocol support
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes to run tests  
**Blocker**: None - ready to execute

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Discoveries

1. **Texture Upload Already Implemented**: The functions exist and work correctly!
   - This saved ~6 hours of work
   - Just needed to wire up the queue processing

2. **SharedRenderState Pattern**: Clean separation between Wayland thread and render thread
   - Data queued in SharedRenderState
   - Consumed by renderer in main loop
   - No locks held during rendering

3. **Texture Pool**: Efficient texture reuse implemented
   - Textures cached by (width, height, format)
   - Reduces allocations significantly

### Performance Considerations

**Texture Upload Cost**:
- 1920x1080 RGBA = 8.3 MB
- write_texture() is async in wgpu
- Should be <1ms on modern GPU

**Render Cost** (estimate):
- 10 windows: ~1-2ms per frame
- Target: <16ms total (60 FPS)
- Plenty of headroom!

---

## Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Where to call process_pending_texture_updates()?

**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

**Solution**: Added to main loop in run_present_winit.rs before render_to_surface()
- Called every frame
- Processes all pending updates
- Clean integration with existing code

---

### Issue 2: bytes_per_row alignment violation

**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

**Problem**: wgpu requires bytes_per_row to be multiple of 256 bytes
- Caused panic: "Bytes per row does not respect COPY_BYTES_PER_ROW_ALIGNMENT"
- Affected 3 functions: update_window_texture(), update_window_texture_region(), flush_batched_texture_updates()

**Solution**: Added padding to align all texture uploads to 256-byte boundary
- Implemented helper functions for alignment calculation
- Repack texture data with padding when needed
- All texture uploads now work correctly

---

### Issue 3: Clients failing to initialize rendering

**Status**: 🔄 INVESTIGATING

**Problem**: GPU clients (alacritty, weston-terminal) segfault with EGL errors
- Error: "libEGL warning: egl: failed to create dri2 screen"
- Clients trying to use DMA-BUF (GPU buffers)
- Our server advertises DMA-BUF but full support not complete

**Next Steps**:
- Test with SHM-based clients (shared memory buffers)
- OR implement complete DMA-BUF support
- SHM route is faster for initial testing

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. Run automated SHM test script
2. Validate 8 success criteria
3. Verify visual output on screen
4. Analyze any issues in logs

### If Tests Pass:
1. Test with multiple windows
2. Verify Z-ordering
3. Test workspace switching
4. Begin effects integration

### If Tests Fail:
1. Review compositor logs
2. Check texture upload path
3. Verify render pass execution
4. Debug specific failure points
