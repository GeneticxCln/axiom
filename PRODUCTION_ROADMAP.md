# Axiom Production Roadmap: From Simulation to Real Wayland Compositor

## Current Status Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Excellent Foundation)
Your Axiom project has an **outstanding architecture** and demonstrates sophisticated understanding of compositor design:

- **üèóÔ∏è Excellent Architecture**: Clean modular design with proper separation of concerns
- **‚öôÔ∏è Complete Configuration System**: TOML-based config with validation and defaults
- **üéØ Advanced Features**: 
  - Niri-inspired scrollable workspaces with smooth animations
  - Hyprland-style visual effects system with GPU acceleration
  - Spring-based physics for natural animations
  - Comprehensive shader management for effects

### ‚ùå What Needs to be Real (Current Limitations)
The current implementation is a sophisticated **simulation** rather than a functional compositor:

1. **No Real Wayland Protocol Handling**: Missing actual client communication
2. **Smithay Integration Incomplete**: Using simplified backend instead of real Smithay
3. **No Window Rendering**: No actual rendering pipeline or surface management
4. **Simulated Input**: No real keyboard/mouse/touch input processing
5. **No Client Applications**: Cannot run actual Wayland applications

## Transformation Strategy: 3-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Real Smithay Integration (4-6 weeks)
**Goal**: Replace simulation with actual Wayland compositor functionality

#### 1.1 Core Smithay Backend
- **Replace** `smithay_backend_simple.rs` with full Smithay integration
- **Implement** real Wayland protocols: `wl_compositor`, `xdg_shell`, `wl_seat`
- **Add** proper surface management and damage tracking
- **Connect** to real hardware: DRM for displays, libinput for input devices

#### 1.2 Real Window Management
- **Map** Smithay surfaces to your `AxiomWindow` system
- **Implement** XDG shell protocol handlers for window creation/destruction
- **Add** proper focus management and keyboard/mouse input routing
- **Connect** workspace system to real window events

#### 1.3 Basic Rendering Pipeline
- **Set up** OpenGL/Vulkan renderer using Smithay's renderer traits
- **Implement** basic window rendering without effects
- **Add** damage tracking for efficient screen updates

**Expected Outcome**: Basic tiling Wayland compositor that can run simple applications

### Phase 2: Visual Effects Integration (4-6 weeks)  
**Goal**: Connect your advanced effects system to real rendering

#### 2.1 GPU Rendering Pipeline
- **Integrate** your `EffectsEngine` with Smithay's renderer

#### 2.3 Advanced Effects
- **Implement** real blur effects on window surfaces
- **Add** drop shadows with proper lighting
- **Create** rounded corner rendering with anti-aliasing
- **Integrate** spring physics for natural window movements

**Expected Outcome**: Feature-complete compositor with niri+Hyprland functionality

### Phase 3: Production Polish (2-4 weeks)
**Goal**: Make it stable and usable for daily use

#### 3.1 Stability & Testing
- **Add** comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Implement** crash protection and state recovery
- **Create** automated testing for real applications
- **Add** memory leak detection and performance profiling

#### 3.2 Application Compatibility
- **Test** with major applications: Firefox, VSCode, GIMP, etc.
- **Fix** compatibility issues and edge cases
- **Add** proper XWayland support for X11 applications
- **Implement** clipboard, drag-and-drop protocols

#### 3.3 Distribution & Installation
- **Create** installation scripts and packages
- **Add** session manager integration
- **Write** user documentation and configuration guides
- **Set up** continuous integration and releases

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Smithay Integration Pattern
```rust
// Replace smithay_backend_simple.rs with real implementation
pub struct AxiomSmithayBackend {
    // Real Smithay components
    display: Display<AxiomState>,
    event_loop: EventLoop<AxiomState>,
    backend: WinitGraphicsBackend, // or DrmBackend for real hardware
    
    // Compositor states
    compositor_state: CompositorState,
    xdg_shell_state: XdgShellState,
    seat_state: SeatState<AxiomState>,
    
    // Your custom systems
    workspace_manager: Arc<Mutex<ScrollableWorkspaces>>,
    effects_engine: Arc<Mutex<EffectsEngine>>,
}

impl XdgShellHandler for AxiomState {
    fn new_toplevel(&mut self, surface: ToplevelSurface) {
        // Create AxiomWindow and add to workspace system
        let window = AxiomWindow::from_surface(surface);
        self.workspace_manager.lock().unwrap().add_window(window.id());
        
        // Trigger window appear animation
        self.effects_engine.lock().unwrap().animate_window_appear(window.id());
    }
}
```

### Rendering Pipeline Integration
```rust
// Connect your effects to real rendering
impl AxiomRenderer {
    fn render_frame(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // 1. Get workspace layout (your existing code)
        let layouts = self.workspace_manager.calculate_workspace_layouts();
        
        // 2. Apply effects transformations
        for (window_id, layout) in layouts {
            let effects = self.effects_engine.get_window_effects(window_id);
            
            // 3. Render with effects (new - real rendering)
            self.render_window_with_effects(window_id, layout, effects)?;
        }
        
        // 4. Apply workspace transition effects
        self.render_workspace_transition()?;
        
        // 5. Present frame
        self.present()?;
    }
}
```
